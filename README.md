# Snack's Prediction Project

This project is my final assignment of 'DSApps' course in TLV university which got the highest classification accuracy. 
The goal was to classify snack's category using structured (mainly text features) and unstrctured (images) data.
The project consist of two main parts:  
* Exploratory data analysis 
* ML and DL models for prediction 

## Requirements
* Python 3.*
* R 3.*

## Data Description
The dataset has ~35K snacks products (train and test combined), in 6 categories:

* Popcorn, Peanuts, Seeds & Related Snacks
* Candy
* Cookies & Biscuits
* Chips, Pretzels & Snacks
* Chocolate
* Snack, Energy & Granola Bars
* Cakes, Cupcakes, Snack Cakes

And the data contains 4 datasets:

1. `food_train.csv` and `food_test.csv`
2. `nutrients.csv`
3. `food_nutrients.csv`
4. train and test images for all snack products (not included)

## Files Description
* final_project_instructions.pdf - fully detailed instruction.
* final_proj.pdf - the final report of the project including EDA and modeling strategy and results.
* final_proj.Rmd - R markdown file contains all the relevant code in R
* project_nn.ipynb - jupyter notebook file contains DL models in Python.
* final_preds - the folder of the final prediction from 3 different models.
